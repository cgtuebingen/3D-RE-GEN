# About
We propose single-image 3D scene reconstruction for producing complete, editable scenes from a single photograph. Our method reconstructs individual objects and the surrounding background as textured 3D assets, enabling coherent scene assembly from minimal input. We combine instance segmentation, context-aware generative inpainting, 2D-to-3D asset creation, and constrained optimization to recover physically plausible geometry, materials, and lighting. The resulting scenes preserve correct spatial relationships, lighting consistency, and material fidelity, making them suitable for production-ready workflows.

# Code
Paper is currently under review, we will realse the code shortly (~ end of january 2026) in a cleaned version. Up until then if you have any questions regarding the project or need material to compare against fast, feel free to contact us.
